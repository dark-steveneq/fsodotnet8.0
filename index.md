# FreeSO .NET 8.0 Port
Port of the original .NET Framework 4.5 codebase to .NET 8.0

This is not related in any way with [Riperiperi](https://github.com/riperiperi) or the FreeSO development team. This is a passion project that aims to make the engine easier to work with for anyone who dares to do anything with it.

# State
Currently only the server works. You can join it using the official FreeSO client. For some reason Alphavile causes the client to freeze when loading. Because of that, the default city is now Charvatia.

# Development on Linux
This project seems perfectly compilable (outside of compilation issues) on Linux using VSCode and `dotnet` CLI. If you're using an open source build of VSCode (like VSCodium) you should concider using the proprietary build since debugging is disabled on those because of the debugger's license

# Credits
- [Riperiperi](https://github.com/riperiperi) - Making FreeSO in the first place
- [JDrocks450](https://github.com/JDrocks450) - Making [nio2so](https://github.com/JDrocks450/nio2so), a Pre-Alpha server emulator which I borrowed some code from and actually never ended up using it but his project is still worth to mention either way
